Internship project - Road Lane Line Detection System

The Road Lane Line Detection System is a project aimed at enhancing road safety by detecting lane lines on roads using computer vision techniques. The system uses video footage from a car's camera to identify and highlight lane boundaries, helping drivers stay within their lanes and avoid accidents. It employs libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and MoviePy for video handling, making it a practical tool for real-time lane detection in various driving conditions.
